# EDA
# Question: What makes a game popular on Steam?
# Definition of popular: many regular players

# Hypothesis / Variable Selection
# Price could be a variable that makes a game popular because it allows anyone with access to Steam to try the game.
# Positive ratings could be a variable that makes a game popular because it advertises the game to new players.
# Certain categories and genres could be more preferred than others.

# owners, price, positive_ratings, negative_ratings

plot(steam$price,jitter(log(steam$owners),2),xlim=c(0,80))
plot(jitter(steam$release_year,2),jitter(log(steam$owners),2))
plot(log(steam$total_ratings),jitter(log(steam$owners),2))

# we need to jitter "owners" because it is in categorical ranges
